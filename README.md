Application Features

Map Navigation

View value your time and in a campus as big as 550 acres its hard to find your way to the exact event you don't want to miss. Hence we have a Google Map integration in the app with markers for all genres of events, utilities and much more which are dynamically updated.

Event Notifications

We know how important it is to be at the right time at a must attend event , thus we have a remind feature for you , lest you miss it.

Google Drive Schedule Support

No more app updates and no more large data consumption. Our Schedule is updated in real-time on the app start and cached for you.

Get Directions

Every event page has a Get Directions button so no more nano-searching maps to find your event path.

Open Source

We Share love | We share Code.

Cache Optimisation

The Google Maps and App essentials are stored in the cache for you to cherish later.

Have a Nice Visit !
