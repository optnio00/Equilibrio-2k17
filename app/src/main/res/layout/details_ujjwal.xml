        android:text="Man is a witness to the crime he himself is committing. Couple a high degree environmental degradation with a serious energy crisis and the human generation will have the perfect recipe for a massive catastrophe. The pollution levels in the air are so high that if it weren't for our lungs there'd be no place to put it all. The exploitation rate of fossils is on an all time high. The demand of megawatts is in millions. Today’s generation is in the midst of a population explosion which further stresses on the needs of cleaner basic amenities, effective waste management and demand of green energy. One does not need to see far to conclude that disaster is in the making."/>
