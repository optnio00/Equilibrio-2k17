        Navigation is one of the main modules in a mobile robotic system. A large body of research works has been conducted in the field of mobile robot navigation.The most common and popular navigation methods proposed to date rely on dead-reckoning-based, landmark-based, vision-based and behavior based techniques.Common problem pertaining to these techniques is that they depend on complex image processing algorithms, expensive hardware and prior knowledge of environment.

        rBot-RFID is a new approach to a robotic navigation through a grid of RFID tags. Workshop will focus on building a navigation system using the RF signal from the RFID tags as a feedback signals to navigate a mobile robot with integrated RFID reader within an unknown or uncertain indoor environment. This method is computationally simpler and more cost-effective than many of its counterparts in the state of the art. It is also modular and easy to implement since it is independent of the robotÂ’s architecture and its workspace.
