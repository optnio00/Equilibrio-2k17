        Augmented Reality is a digital layer over the real world that you can't see with the naked eye but you can see with the camera on your smartphone or computer.Augmented Reality technology has matured to a point where organizations can use it as an internal tool to complement and enhance business processes, workflows and employee training. A computer that used to require hardware with size of an arcade case to produce enough processing power for augmented reality, can now fit in the palm of your hand. Google Glass, innovative in its design and features, is simply the next logical step.
